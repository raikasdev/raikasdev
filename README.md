**Hello! I am Roni √Ñik√§s, a software developer from Central Finland!** \
I mostly use Node.js, React and TypeScript. I also have experience with Java, Python, Flutter and C#. I recently have done bit more frontend work with React, but I still do lots of backend stuff! \
Some technologies I love are [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Ne**s**tJS](https://nestjs.com), [Ne**x**tJS](https://nextjs.com) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). \
I have also done some security researching stuff in the past, and have gotten #3 place on [challenge.fi season 1](https://challenge.fi) and participated in [1337UP1121](https://1337.intigriti.io) event by Visma!

**If you want to see projects that I'm most proud of check my pinned repos below!** \
There's also some projects I have done under the [Testausserveri](https://github.com/Testausserveri) organization.
