**Hello! I am Roni Äikäs, a 15-year-old full-stack web developer and entrepreneur from Central Finland!** \
I'm currently orintented more towards front-end development, using tools like WordPress, React, TypeScript and Vite to create awesome websites and web applications.
I also have experience with Java and Python.

## I'm open for freelance work!
**I develop websites using WordPress and custom-made Gutenberg blocks**, instead of using bloated ready-made themes like Astra and page editors like Elementor. They're developed using React for the dashboard to make editing your website super easy, and then compiled into HTML to be served to your visitors, keeping your website super fast. If you're interested or want to learn more, send me an email at [roni@mikroni.fi](mailto:roni@mikroni.fi), and let's get to work!

**I have also lot's of experience with frontend development with React and backend development with Node (mostly Express, NestJS and Fastify)**. So, if you need a helping hand with those, I'm open for work in those kind of projects too!

## Projects I've worked on
Most of these have their repositories pinned, check below!

- [Mastopoet](https://mastopoet.raikas.dev) (~70 Github Stars 🌟) - Screenshot tool for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) that allows you to create beautiful and clean screenshots with customizable look
- [Tusked](https://tusked.app) - Upcoming modern and customizable Mastodon web client (+ PWA) built on top of Preact, SCSS, Vite and Masto.js.
- [Novu](https://novu.co) - The open-source notification infrastructure for developers. Worked as an contractor and developed integrations to push notification services (APNS, FCM) and webhooks. 
- [Mastodon4 Redirect](https://github.com/raikasdev/mastodon4-redirect) - Browser extension that redirects users to their home instance.
- [Ritta](https://github.com/rittaschool) - Open source student information system project, which was abandoned due to prolonged development caused by "must be best" and bleeding edge tech stack slowing development down.

I have also done some security researching stuff in the past, and have gotten #3 place on [challenge.fi season 1](https://challenge.fi).
